        <span class="caption-title">Hi, I'm Olivia!</span><br><br>
        <span class="caption-meta">Iâ€™m passionate about creating clear, effective visualizations and maps that enable decision-makers to make informed decisions quickly and confidently. 
        With experience in government and international organizations, <span class="highlight"><strong>I thrive at the intersection of design, data, and geography.</strong></span>
        </span><br><br>
        <span class="caption-meta">For the past 6 years, I was a cartographer and data visualization designer at the U.S. Department of State, where I created maps and graphics to support policymakers and diplomatic missions worldwide.
        Working in the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/us-dos-hiu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU)</a>, my primary focus was on visualizing complex data related to humanitarian crises, helping to inform and guide U.S. government responses.
        HIU's flagship product, the one-page infographic, was widely used by senior officials and diplomats to quickly grasp the situation on the ground and make informed decisions.</span><br><br>
        <span class="caption-meta">Other publicly available maps from my time at the State Department included maps to accompany <a href="https://statemag.state.gov/category/post-of-the-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Post of the Month" articles in State Magazine</a>, as well as maps for various annual reports. </span><br><br>
  <span class="caption-meta"><span class="highlight"><strong>I'm currently seeking my next role in data visualization, GIS, or cartography</strong></span>, where I can leverage my skills and experience to make a meaningful impact. If you're interested in working together or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!</span>
